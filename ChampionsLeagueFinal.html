The city of Cardiff is a port city on the south coast of Wales, it also the capital of Wales. The european league known as the UEFA Champions League is a competition of Soccer, also known as Football to the rest of the world, involving the top best club teams in all of Europe. The Final will be played on the 3rd of June of 2017 and the two finalist are yet to be determined. <br> <br> 

Events like these can be an easy target for Terrorist, Past events like the the bombing in Paris, France near the stadium, there had to be immediate evacuation and had to cancel the game. Another is the bombing in Dortmund, Germany not happened long ago when the Soccer team was heading to the stadium and a bomb went off in the bus one of the players were injured. <br> <br>

So now Cardiff police are taking this as an opportunity to catch any person that can be a threat. But what exactly is their plan and how will they do it? According to BBC News, “South Wales Police has provided £177,000 for facial recognition technology that they plan to use at the stadium.” If we’re talking in U.S Dollars they have provided  192.000.00$ Dollars for this kind of technology.  <br> <br>
		  

Also stated on BBC News, Faces will be scanned at the main entrance of the Stadium and Cardiff's central railway station.They can then be matched against 500,000 "custody images" stored by local police forces.South Wales Police confirmed the pilot and said it was a "unique opportunity".A report on the plan was first posted by tech news site Motherboard.
		  Around 70,000 fans are expected in the stadium and Cardiff is preparing for a further 100,000 people to visit the city on the day.Real-time facial recognition is planned to be used "in and around the Principality Stadium and Cardiff central train station on the day of the UCL Champions League Final", the contract says. <br> <br> 

But there is a slight concern involving with this kind of technology. According to Engadget.com  “At the same time, there's also a concern that the technology just isn't ready. Face recognition ideally relies on clearly visible head shots. How do you capture those shots when thousands of people are swarming through a stadium or train station? While some previous uses at festivals were deemed successful, a recent test at a carnival by London's Metropolitan Police didn't identify a single person of interest despite 454 arrests. That is what the test is for, though it could determine whether or not large-scale face recognition is worth the effort.”

Police are also taking as a concern that the technology that they are using, can target innocent people and gain too much face recognition info then necessary. Police are taking extra precautions and limiting their standards for people who are not a target. <br> <br>

Everyone who is headed to the Champions League Final are gonna be part of a massive experiment in security and privacy uproar. This opportunity and experim</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF">ent will determine if this can not only be just be used in Europe but around the World.</span></h5></div>
