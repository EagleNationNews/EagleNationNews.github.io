		  <br />
		  <p dir="ltr"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now Navy Federal employs about 5,000 people in Pensacola according to Thomas Greek, who is the Vice President for learning, development and communications at Navy Federal&rsquo;s Pensacola campus. Navy federal has been rated as the number 1 health insurance provider, but even then the benefits of being an employee at Navy Federal don&rsquo;t stop. </p>
		  <br />
		  <p dir="ltr"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of working for Navy Federal include Pet Insurance, Paid Retirement, help with adoption and attorneys when needed, paid maternity leave, Pension Plans, and not only that but when you&rsquo;re working for them 14% of your yearly salary goes to your 401k plan.</p>
		  <br />
		  <p dir="ltr"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now that you know some of the benefits you&rsquo;d get working with Navy Federal, let me include that at their main campus in pensacola, navy federal has things like an indoor gym (which includes the personal trainers that are available and the masseuse), there are also outside basketball courts, a volleyball area, tennis courts, and even a small doctors office that can get your prescriptions brought to you at the campus. And did i mention that the cafeteria there is amazing and has fresh food everyday.</p>
		  <br />
		  <p dir="ltr"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However to work at such an amazing place such as this, Navy Federal has morals that they want employees to have and always remember, first is service, Navy Federal strongly believes that their duty and every employee&rsquo;s duty is to serve those who serve us. Second is commitment, to be an employee you have to be committed to what you&rsquo;re doing no matter what. And last but not least you need to have integrity, always have your own morals that you live by and make honesty a top priority. </p>
