Switzerland is taking their supermarkets by storm with their new insect based products! The start-up product is called Essento, which are meatballs and burger patties based with grasshoppers, crickets, and mealworms. An article on Food and Wine states, “the burgers will also contain rice, carrots, and spices such as oregano and chili and a two pack will cost 8.95 francs ($9.24), which is about twice the price of Coop’s Naturplan Bio organic beef burgers and almost five times as much as the least expensive burgers in its online store.” These burgers are top of the line, price-wise at the moment, and switzerland says it’s worth it! 

 The Swiss food safety laws had been revised, to allow insect into their foods and Switzerland is the first nation in Europe to integrate the new change. Most people would exclaim in horror or pledge to starvation before bringing a creepy crawler to their lips. But according to Fox News, “the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization states that not only is it perfectly healthy to do so, but that insects are consumed by 2 billion people worldwide.” Belgian Researchers conducted three rounds of taste tests, a blind one, an informed, and expected taste test. Though, there were more distrust in the burgers during the blind test, when informed the burger contained mealworms, the participants actually enjoyed them. 

Food Navigator’s article on the experiment stated, that the consumer said the bug burgers were drier and less juicy than the competing meat burgers. So the developers will be tweaking the sensory qualities of the burgers before the next release. The bugs contain a considerable amount of protein including fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Between its low environmental cost and health benefit, a little more crunch in their double pounder is all in a day’s work for Switzerland.
