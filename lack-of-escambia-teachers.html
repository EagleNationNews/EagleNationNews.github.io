  <h4>Transcript</h4>
	  
	  <h6 id="JonesLOTscript">  Who taught you to write? Who makes their best attempt to nudge you in the right direction in life? What occupation is so important, that the fabric of society would crumble with the absence of them? Teachers. Currently, there’s been a slowly decreasing number of educators for not only Escambia, but Santa Rosa as well. So much so, that they are holding a teacher hiring event from the 11th of March to the extended date of 29th of April. This is not a new problem however, because according to PNJ.com; “There was a 35 percent reduction in teacher education enrollments between 2009 and 2014.”
		  <br>
		  <br>

          Two factors that lead to this problem are the pay/budget and growing career choices.
According to BLS.gov, high school teachers should make an average of $57,000 a year. Escambia and neighboring counties make lower than the national average, and a fraction goes back into resources needed for the teacher’s classroom.  As technology increases, more and more lucrative job opportunities open up and demand for people to hold them increases, the amount of students that want to become teachers could potentially become a lot less.
		  <br>
		  <br>

          Escambia has been trying to sway teachers in by an online screening process that could potentially tackle the dilemma for not only our county, but for an attempt at the entire statewide shortages. That’s not all that has been done to assist the problem though. Here at Pine Forest, we have the Future Teacher academy to get involved with students who are interested in following a career in teaching, and show them what it takes to become adequate educators in the future. 
		  <br>
		  <br>

          Recently, i’ve been given the privilege to speak to Mrs. Johnson of the Future Teacher Academy and one of her students on behalf of the lack of teachers.
		  <br>
		  <br>

          For all the future teachers listening in, just remember you’ll be given the opportunity to mold the minds of countless students for generations to come. For all the current teachers listening in, Thank You.

          I’m Brian, back to you Anchors.
