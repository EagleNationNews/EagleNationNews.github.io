		  The nightshift was disrupted at the Coca Cola Knockmore Hill facility in Lisburn, Ireland when human waste was distributed into coke cans after the machines became clogged. The New York Post informs that “affected cans arrived from a German supplier that hadn’t been used previously,” and a source told the Irish Independent “the machines had to be turned off for about 15 hours to be cleaned.” <br> Fox News claims the source told the paper “The rumour is that some poor immigrants could have made that long journey in the (truck) and … in their desperation were forced to use the cans instead of a toilet.” The question is “ . . if they did make that journey, where are they now?” The Police Service of Northern Ireland claims detectives are investigating another incident in the Lisburn area after reports of more contaminated containers.<br>The Migration Policy Institute confirmed that Ireland’s economic prosperity caused it to have a rapid increase in migrants from outside the European Union within the past twenty years. However, Germany and Ireland are both inside the European Union, so shouldn’t there have been an easier way for the immigrants to migrate? Work Permit clarifies that, unlike the UK, “Ireland's immigration system is not points based, and instead is geared towards allowing migrants with the skills and expertise needed by the Irish economy to get a visa with ease.”  Perhaps they lacked the expertise needed making it harder to get in and causing them to resort to hitching a ride on a Coca Cola truck.<br>Coca Cola reassures that this incident does not affect any products currently for sale, but what about the alleged immigrants? Are immigration policies too strict or is it okay for a prosperous country to only accept skilled workers? I’m Kaylie, back at you, anchors.
