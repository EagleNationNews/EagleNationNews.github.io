	    <p dir="ltr">During the summer I went to the National Flight Academy. The National Flight Academy is a summer camp that happens on The Pensacola Naval Air Station. This camp is supposed to simulate being on an aircraft carrier. This camp is give you a hands on experience of what an actual Navy Pilot would do while on an aircraft carrier. &nbsp;They have three different camps, Adventures which last one day, Cruises which last three days, and the Deployments which last 6 days. I did a deployment. </p>
	    <br />
	    <p dir="ltr">The routine went as follows &ldquo;Wake up at 6:30 am, make your bed and get dressed, hour of free time, then head to the mess deck for breakfast, after breakfast its lessons. My favorite lesson was when we into the land survival room and looked at the pilot's vest with all the survival gear. then onto to squad activities. Squad activities typically involved us going to the Navy Museum or Hangar Bay One. One Squad Activity was we went to the air traffic control tower that's on base and got to go up and see the inside of a control tower. Then we typically did some kind of pass the time game till it was time for lunch. After lunch it was time for missions. Missions typically started with a briefing in the Joint Operations Control Center or the JOC. The JOC is the control tower where the comms were to talk to the jets and give them directions. This was where we either went over what we were flying or where we went over how to help the people we were in the control room for. If we weren&rsquo;t flying we were in the JOC being the control tower. If we weren't in the JOC being the control tower we were out flying the missions. In between flying and being in the control room where planning missions in the Joint Intelligence Center or the JIC. This is where we got distances, positions and bearing from the Aircraft Carrier to wherever we needed to fly to. One mission we had todo was &ldquo;fly&rdquo; an air show over Pensacola Beach. There was no grade or score but we did have to follow the flight plan we made while we were in the JIC. &nbsp;&ldquo;Disciplines include aerodynamics, propulsion, navigation, communications, flight physiology and meteorology, along with core values, teamwork, and leadership skills development.&rdquo; &nbsp;says nationalflightacademy.com. </p>
	    <br />
	    <p dir="ltr">In addition to the simulated experience of staying on an Aircraft Carrier at the end of your experience there is a graduation where you get a pair of &ldquo;National Flight Academy Wings&rdquo;, A Certificate saying you have passed and earned the wings, and a patch that says &ldquo;Ambition CVT-11&rdquo;. &ldquo;The experience was amazing and I loved it. The simulators were really fun to &ldquo;fly&rdquo; and they experience really made me feel like I was on an Aircraft Carrier and flying the plans&rdquo; says Melissa Schumacher who went to the National Flight Academy in one of the first few years after it began. Now depending on what type of stay you do it is expensive. Now certain programs have scholarships like Navy Federal which is where I got my scholarship from to go to the National Flight Academy. I got my scholarship because my grandma works at Navy Federal and I had to write an essay on why I felt like the National Flight Academy would help me in life. Some of my squad mates came all the way from Kentucky with a program called NSTI. NSTI is the National Summer Transportation Institute program that goes around taking high school kids to different college programs and campuses. There also other scholarships that will help you go to the National Flight Academy all you have to do is check on the National Flight Academy website and other summer programs to see if you&rsquo;re eligible for certain scholarships.</p>
